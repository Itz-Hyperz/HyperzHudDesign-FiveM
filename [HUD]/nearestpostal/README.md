# Nearest Postals

This script displays a nearest postal next to where PLD would go and also has a command to draw a route to a specific postal

## Installation

1. There are 2 ways to install it, and I recommend the first
    1. Run the following command in a terminal
        - `git clone https://github.com/blockba5her/nearest-postal.git`
    2. Download the code from the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/blockba5her/nearest-postal/releases)
2. As of now, this script supports 3 postal maps. From what I have seen, these are the most popular
    - `new-postals.json` -> [New and Improved Postals](https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-postal-code-map-new-improved-v1-1/147458)
    - `old-postals.json` -> [Original Postals](https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-modified-street-names-w-postal-numbers/8717)
    - `ocrp-postals.json` -> [OCRP Postals](https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-ocrp-community-releases/166277)
3. To setup the postal map, open the `__resource.lua` file and change the variable `postalFile` to one of the files above
    - **NOTE**: This defaults as the `new-postals.json` file

## Command

To draw a route to a certain postal, type `/postal [postalName]` and to remove just type `/postal`

It will automatically remove the route when within 100m of the destination

## Development

This script provides a simple way of working on a new postal map

1. In the script, enabled the local variable `dev` near the bottom
2. Restart the script into game
3. Teleport to the first postal code in numerical order
4. Type `/setnext [postalCode]` where postalCode is the postal that you are at
5. Type `/next` to insert it
6. Teleport to the next postal code in numerical order
7. Type `/next` to insert it
8. Repeat from step 6 on

If you make a mistake, you can either remove a specific postal using `/remove [postalCode]` or remove the last postal inserted with `/rl` (this will decrease the next value also)

When done with that, you can print all of the postals you just inserted into console with the `/json` command and then copy it from your `CitizenFX.log` file
