# HyperzHudDesign-FiveM
This is a HUD design for FiveM, not made by me. I just configured it to look good... Including Fax-AOP, Cooldown, Guy293-Voice, streetLabel, Nearest Postal, and carhud!

AGAIN I JUST CONFIGURED THIS!

Also I did edit the cooldown script and Area-of-Patrol script to remove the time from it, and also the cooldown to add a cleaner font and use a remaining text option like DOJRP's cooldown...

If you want the fuel bar like DOJRP has on their vehicles, you can get it using either Legacy Fuel (https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-esx-non-esx-legacyfuel-system/148442), or frfuel (https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-frfuel-v1-7-0/5467)
