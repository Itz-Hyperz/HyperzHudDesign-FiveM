# PLEASE STAR THIS REPOSITORY IF YOU WANT A V2!!

# HyperzHudDesign-FiveM
This is a HUD design for FiveM, not made by me. I just configured it to look good... Including Fax-AOP, Cooldown, Guy293-Voice, streetLabel, Nearest Postal, and carhud!

- fax-aop - FAXES - https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-area-of-patrol-set-aop-ft-draw-text-peacetime-more-aop-3-4/85532 | (Removed Time)
- cooldown - Scott_UK - https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-priority-cooldown/72856 | (Added time remaining for cooldown)

AGAIN I JUST CONFIGURED THIS!

Also I did edit the cooldown script and Area-of-Patrol script to remove the time from it, and also the cooldown to add a cleaner font and use a remaining text option like DOJRP's cooldown...

If you want the fuel bar like DOJRP has on their vehicles, you can get it using either Legacy Fuel (https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-esx-non-esx-legacyfuel-system/148442), or frfuel (https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-frfuel-v1-7-0/5467)
